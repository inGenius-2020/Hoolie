## Zip everything

By: Mohamed Ayaan 

The goal is to make an application that allows you to obtain information about which zipping process would be the most optimal for a particular file (Video, Image, Text, etc.) 

Lets try and make our own  `WEISMANN SCORE` eh?

BTW I am looking at this being a backend heavy program so be wary

### Languages:
1. Golang(for parallelism) / Rust (for speed) 
2. Next.js / Remix.js (to make Arnav notice you)

 This is what a medium level difficulty backend would look like for golang (Cheers Navin!)

## 1. Create atleast one zipping algorithm on golang

Why dont you get familiar and start off by utilising a zipping library to try and zip the file in any manner. You could make it so that the file contents could be accepted on postman or insomnia.

`You want to delve deeper and come up with your own alogrithm for zipping? Be my guest this can only be more beneficial to yourself.`

Parallelising would be welcome but I wouldnt bet on that being accepted.

## 2. Come up with a formula via which one would be able to quantify the zipping potential

Now that you came up with the zipping formula make another function/module that would be able to determine a score for the zipping.

One would wish for the formula to be based on time, compression ratio, etc. But hey you found a metric that could be of siginificance that would be awesome !


## 3. Make a frontend (finally jeez)

Do not look at my own profile, cause you might just call me a hypocrite but now you all better have gotten started on making a simple frontend.

A simple score displayer along with the ability to download the zipped file generated would be awesome, previous statistics or any analytical models/shapes.


## 4.  `Once may be a fluke lets see if you can do it again`

Now that you are done with one implementation of the zipping technique,**do it again** see any optimisations, using more and different libraries for this will be noticed.

I want to see you all go wild come on people lets do this.

## 5.  Parallelising the process
----
You may have seen that doing all the zips at the same time might be a `bit slow, like really slow, like holy shit this is slow`. Now I introduce you into parallelising your methods, with one mind numbing understanding of how it works later you will finally be able to achieve slightly better speeds.
